                    <p>You agree that from time to time we may remove the Service for indefinite periods of time or cancel the
                        Service at any time, without notice to you.</p>
                    <p>You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the service is at your sole risk. The service
                        and all products and services delivered to you through the service are (except as expressly stated
                        by us) provided 'as is' and 'as available' for your use, without any representation, warranties or

                    <p>In no case shall Arcticode AS, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, partners, agents, contractors,
                        interns, suppliers, service providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any
                        direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including,
                        without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or
                        any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or
